= id3lib-ruby installation instructions

== Binary package (Windows)

There are precompiled binary gems available for Windows, so the installation
is as simple as typing the following and selecting the newest mswin32 gem:

  gem install id3lib-ruby

== Source package

For other systems, there is a RubyGems package or a compressed archive.

=== Prerequisites

Before installing id3lib-ruby, you need to install the underlying id3lib
library and, depending on your system, set CONFIGURE_ARGS.

==== Ubuntu and Debian Linux

Install libid3-dev and be sure to have ruby-dev installed, otherwise you
won't be able to build Ruby extensions.

  sudo aptitude install libid3-dev ruby-dev g++

==== Fedora Linux

  sudo yum install id3lib-devel ruby-devel gcc-c++

==== Gentoo Linux

  sudo emerge -n id3lib

==== Mac OS X

If you use the Ruby distribution provided by Mac OS X, you need to have Apple's
Xcode installed in order to be able to build extensions.

Now, either install id3lib through MacPorts or Fink, or by downloading and
compiling manually.

===== MacPorts

  sudo port install id3lib

===== Fink

  sudo apt-get install id3lib4-dev

=== Installing id3lib-ruby

Now you're ready to install id3lib-ruby. If you use RubyGems, run the
following and select the newest version marked "ruby":

  sudo gem install id3lib-ruby

Or if you install from the archive, unpack it and do:

  sudo ruby setup.rb

==== Mac OS X

On Mac OS X 10.5 and later, Ruby tries to compile the extension for multiple
architectures (universal build) and fails. You have to specify the right
architecture manually. For 64 bit Intel processors, do:

  sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install id3lib-ruby

For 32 bit Intel processors:

  sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install id3lib-ruby

And for PPC processors:

  sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch ppc" gem install id3lib-ruby
