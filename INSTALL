= id3lib-ruby installation instructions

== Binary package (Windows)

There are precompiled binary gems available for Windows, so the installation
is as simple as typing the following and selecting the newest mswin32 gem:

  gem install id3lib-ruby

== Source package

For other systems, there is a RubyGems package or a compressed archive.

=== Prerequisites

Before installing id3lib-ruby, you need to install the underlying id3lib
library and, depending on your system, set CONFIGURE_ARGS.

==== Ubuntu and Debian Linux

Install libid3-dev and be sure to have ruby-dev installed, otherwise you
won't be able to build Ruby extensions.

  sudo aptitude install libid3-dev ruby-dev g++

==== Fedora Linux

  sudo yum install id3lib-devel ruby-devel gcc-c++

==== Gentoo Linux

  sudo emerge -n id3lib

==== Mac OS X

If you use the Ruby distribution provided by Mac OS X, you need to have Apple's
Xcode installed in order to be able to build extensions.

Now, either do a manual compilation (see below) or install through Fink or
DarwinPorts. With Fink, you need the id3lib4-dev package:

  sudo apt-get install id3lib4-dev

Fink puts the library and header files in /sw. In order to enable the
id3lib-ruby install program to find them, do:

  export CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-opt-dir=/sw"

==== Manual compilation

Download, compile and install id3lib. When installing in /usr/local, you
have to set CONFIGURE_ARGS:

  export CONFIGURE_ARGS="--with-opt-dir=/usr/local"

=== Installing id3lib-ruby

Now you're ready to install id3lib-ruby. If you use RubyGems, run the
following and select the newest version marked "ruby":

  sudo gem install id3lib-ruby

Or if you install from the archive, unpack it and do:

  sudo ruby setup.rb

On Mac OS X 10.5, Ruby tries to compile the extension for both the i386 and ppc
architectures (universal build) and fails. You have to specify the architecture
manually. For Intel processors, do:

  sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install id3lib-ruby

And for PPC processors:

  sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch ppc" gem install id3lib-ruby
