= id3lib-ruby to-do list

The underlying C++ library id3lib is no longer maintained and outdated (no
support for ID3v2.4). Therefore id3lib-ruby is no longer actively developed.
Here's the old to-do list anyway:

* Evaluate an object-oriented way to handle frames, instead of with hashes.
* Make the update! method intelligent, because the call of strip each time
  is very slow and stupid.
* Add UTF-8 support if id3lib can handle it.
